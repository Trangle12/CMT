### Preparation

**Requirements: Pytorch>=1.1.0 and python>=3.6**

1. install [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
2. Download re-ID dataset 
   - [Market-1501](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8-rUzbwVRk0c054eEozWG9COHM/view)
   - [DukeMTMC-reID](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jjE85dRCMOgRtvJ5RQV9-Afs-2_5dY3O/view)
   - [MSMT17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08565)
3. Put the data under the dataset directory. Training, query and test sub-folder should named as bounding_box_train, query, bounding_box_test, respectively.

### Training

Download the datasets and put them into the right place.
Check and run the shell script `train.sh`:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ./train.sh # run on GPU 0
```

### Evaluation

You can run evaluation on any datasets with model weight provided.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python evaluate.py --weight /path/to/model/weight.pth # run on GPU 0
```
